23. In this image (img1), although it appear to have over exposure problems, but it does not affect our object detection because:
a. Its a Lambo in the picture
b. We can use algorithm to pull back the exposure
c. Object is green
d. it builds enough contrast as the background appear to have enough noise so that we can separate the noise and the clean part of the picture for object detection
e. This picture is a disaster! Whoever took this picture should be kicked in the ass!

24. In this image (img2), although it appear to have under exposure problems, but it does not affect our numerical recognition because:
a. The number is light source and appear clearly in the image.
b. the resolution is high
c. image is black and white so that the noise in color is filtered, so when we deal with this data, it is easier to filter out the parts that we don't need.
